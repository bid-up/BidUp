# BidUp

An auction app with realtime updates using JavaScript and Firebase. As a user, you can sign up and either be an auctioneer or bidder. As an auctioneer, you can create an auction lot by providing a description of the item along with an image url. Once everyone is in the auction lot, you can then start the timer and the bidding can begin. As a bidder, you can enter into an auction room and start bidding!
