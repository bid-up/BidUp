# BidUp

An auction app with realtime updates using JavaScript and Firebase. This app utilizes two users: an auctioneer and a bidder. A user can sign up and either be an auctioneer or bidder. As an auctioneer, you can provide a description of the item along with an image. Once everyone is in the auction room, you can then start the timer and the bidding can begin. As the user, you can enter into an auction room and start bidding!
